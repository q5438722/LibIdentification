This is our anonymous website for ASE'23 submission #109: `Identifying Vulnerable Third-Party Libraries from Textual Descriptions of Vulnerabilities and Libraries`.

In `RQ4_cases.md`, we show some cases of the identification results in RQ4, including both correctly identified libraries, and incorrectly identified libraries.

In `NER_case.md`, we show an motivating example case of our NER model, illustrating its necessity and effectiveness of identifying library-name entities.

We plan to open-source our VulLib dataset, and all evaluation results at the publication of our paper.

We do not open-source our code repository now due to the security requirement of our industry partner. However, in Section 3, we list all details of our approach, so that our approach can be easily reproduced.
