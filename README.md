This is our annymous website for ASE'23 submission #109: `Identifying Vulnerable Third-Party Libraries from Textual Descriptions of Vulnerabilities and Libraries`.

We show some cases of the identification results in RQ4, including both correctly identified libraries, and incorrectly identified libraries.


We plan to open-source our VulLib dataset, and all evaluation results at the publication of 1155 our paper. We do not open-source our code repository now due to the security requirement of our industry partner. However, in Section 3, we list all details of our approach, so that our approach can be easily reproduced.
